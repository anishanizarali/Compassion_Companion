# Compassion_Companion
Compassion is an app matching potential student volunteers to non-profit agencies. This project was developed for Crimson Hacks, a hackathon at the University of Alabama in April 2018. This app matches volunteer agencies with potential student volunteers based on their profile and selected preferences.Compassion combines the fun, gaming card layout that many dating apps use in order to appeal to college students.

# Inspiration
Here at Compassion Companion, we are passionate about helping others. We want to provide the opportunity for better connections between volunteers and organizations. We noticed that college students often want to get involved in their community, but may not know how. We enable college students to find agencies that best suit their interests, needs and busy schedule. We also make this app fun by integrating popular card-layout styles and allowing users to feel as if they are playing a game and getting "matched" with agencies.

# What it does
This app connects non-profit companies and potential volunteers on a common platform. It narrows down potential matches based on user-specified priorities such as age, gender, distance, and date so that the volunteers do not have to look very hard to help others, and for non-profits to promote their event to and make it more successful.

# What's next for Compassion Companion
We are currently working on developing a Progressive web app for Compassion Companion and hope to launch in early 2019. 

# Built with
Java, Coffeescript, Framer, SQL, and more as we move towards a progressive web app!
